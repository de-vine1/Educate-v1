# üìå Phase 1 ‚Äì Course \& Level Management

A. Admin Panel (Backend-first)

1\. Data Model Design



We need 3 main entities with relationships:



Course



CourseId (GUID, PK)



Name (e.g., ‚ÄúATS Examination‚Äù, ‚ÄúICAN Examination‚Äù)



Description (overview of the course)



CreatedAt, UpdatedAt



Level (belongs to a course)



LevelId (GUID, PK)



CourseId (FK) ‚Üí links to Course



Name (e.g., ATS1, ATS2, ATS3, Foundation, Skills, Professional)



Order (e.g., 1, 2, 3 for sequence)



CreatedAt, UpdatedAt



Subject (belongs to a level)



SubjectId (GUID, PK)



LevelId (FK) ‚Üí links to Level



Name (e.g., ‚ÄúCommunication Skills‚Äù, ‚ÄúCorporate Law‚Äù)



CreatedAt, UpdatedAt



üìå Relationships:



Course ‚Üí Levels (One-to-Many)



Level ‚Üí Subjects (One-to-Many)



2\. Admin Features (Controllers \& Endpoints)



Course Management



Create, update, delete courses.



View all courses (paginated list).



Example: POST /api/admin/courses



Level Management



Add levels under a course.



Update level name/order.



Delete levels (with constraints: must handle dependent subjects).



Example: POST /api/admin/courses/{courseId}/levels



Subject Management



Add subjects under a level.



Update subject names.



Delete subjects (constraint: exams/questions under subject must be handled).



Example: POST /api/admin/levels/{levelId}/subjects



3\. Admin Panel UI/UX Flow



Dashboard ‚Üí "Manage Courses" tab.



Add/Edit/Delete Courses.



Within a course, manage its Levels.



Within each level, manage Subjects.



Tree-like structure:



Course ‚Üí Level ‚Üí Subjects

ICAN ‚Üí Foundation ‚Üí Corporate Law

&nbsp;                      Management Accounting

&nbsp;                      Business Environment

&nbsp;                      Financial Accounting



4\. Validation \& Security



Only Admins (Role-Based Access Control via JWT Claims).



Prevent duplicate Course/Level/Subject names under the same hierarchy.



Audit logs for all create/update/delete actions.



B. User-Facing Side (Later Phase)

1\. Course Discovery



Users can view all available professional courses (ATS, ICAN, etc.).



Each course displays:



Course name \& description.



Levels with subjects (expandable).



2\. Enrollment \& Subscription



User selects a Course + Level.



Redirected to payment process (Paystack/Monnify).



On success ‚Üí record created in UserCourses:



UserCourseId



UserId (FK)



CourseId (FK)



LevelId (FK)



SubscriptionStartDate



SubscriptionEndDate (6 months validity)



Status (Active/Expired/Pending)



3\. User Profile Integration



Users see:



Subscribed Courses \& Levels.



Subjects under each level.



Expiry date of each subscription.



Renew button ‚Üí leads back to payment flow.

D. Notifications \& Renewals



System sends:



Email + in-app notification when subscription is about to expire (7 days \& 1 day before).



Renewal link included in notification.



If expired ‚Üí user can no longer access exams/materials under that Level until renewal.





üìå Phase 2 ‚Äì User Enrollment \& Subscription Flow
===

A. Core Concept



Users can enroll in multiple professional courses.



Enrollment is tied to a specific course + level (not the entire course at once).



Subscriptions are bi-annual (6 months validity).



After expiry, users must renew to continue access.



Users can have multiple active subscriptions across different courses and levels.



B. Data Model Design



UserCourses Table (junction table between User, Course, Level)



UserCourseId (GUID, PK)



UserId (FK ‚Üí Users)



CourseId (FK ‚Üí Courses)



LevelId (FK ‚Üí Levels)



SubscriptionStartDate



SubscriptionEndDate (+6 months)



Status (Pending, Active, Expired, Cancelled)



PaymentId (FK ‚Üí Payments)



Payments Table



PaymentId (GUID, PK)



UserId (FK)



Amount



Provider (Paystack/Monnify)



Reference (unique payment reference)



Status (Pending, Success, Failed)



CreatedAt



C. User Flow (Step-by-Step)

1\. Course + Level Selection



User browses available courses \& levels (from Phase 1).



Example: User selects ICAN ‚Üí Foundation.



2\. Enrollment Request



User clicks ‚ÄúSubscribe‚Äù.



Backend creates:



Payments record (Status = Pending).



UserCourses record (Status = Pending).



Redirects to payment gateway (Paystack/Monnify).



3\. Payment Processing



User completes payment on gateway.



Gateway sends webhook notification to backend.



Backend:



Verifies transaction via API.



Updates Payments.Status = Success.



Updates UserCourses.Status = Active.



Sets SubscriptionStartDate = now, SubscriptionEndDate = +6 months.



4\. Post-Enrollment



User is redirected to ‚ÄúEnrollment Success‚Äù page.



Email receipt + subscription details sent via SendGrid.



In-app dashboard updates to show:



Active subscription(s).



Expiry dates.



Remaining validity (countdown).



D. Renewal Flow



Notifications



7 days before expiry ‚Üí email + in-app: ‚ÄúYour subscription for ICAN Foundation expires in 7 days. Click here to renew.‚Äù



1 day before expiry ‚Üí reminder.



On expiry ‚Üí status changes to Expired.



Renewal Action



User clicks Renew.



System initializes a new Payment record.



If successful ‚Üí update existing UserCourses with new SubscriptionEndDate = +6 months.



E. Edge Cases



Multiple Subscriptions: A user can subscribe to ATS1 and ICAN Foundation at the same time. Both have independent expiry dates.



Upgrade Path: If a user finishes ATS1 and wants ATS2 ‚Üí they must enroll and pay separately.



Failed Payment: If payment fails, UserCourses.Status remains Pending. User can retry.



Overlapping Renewals: If user renews early, extend SubscriptionEndDate by 6 months from current expiry, not from today.



F. Notifications \& Receipts



Email Receipt (after payment):



Course + Level



Amount paid



Payment provider + reference



Subscription validity dates



In-app Dashboard:



List of all subscriptions with status (Active/Expired/Pending).



Renewal button.



Email Reminders:



Before expiry.



On expiry.



G. Security Considerations



API keys stored in dotnet user-secrets.



Validate webhook signatures for both Paystack \& Monnify.



Never trust frontend ‚Üí always verify payments server-side.



JWT-secured endpoints:



POST /api/user/enroll



GET /api/user/subscriptions



POST /api/user/renew



H. Flow Diagram

User ‚Üí Select Course + Level ‚Üí Backend creates Payment + UserCourse(Pending) ‚Üí Redirect to Gateway

‚Üí Payment Gateway ‚Üí Webhook ‚Üí Verify Payment ‚Üí Update DB (Success) ‚Üí UserCourse(Active) ‚Üí Notify User





Phase 3 ‚Äì Payments Integration (Monnify + Paystack)
===



This phase ensures users can securely pay for their subscriptions (ATS/ICAN levels) using either Monnify or Paystack. It covers setup, payment initialization, webhook validation, receipts, and subscription linking.



3.1. Payment Providers Setup



API Keys Management



Store Paystack and Monnify keys in .NET user-secrets (not in codebase).



Example:



dotnet user-secrets set "Paystack:SecretKey" "your\_secret\_key\_here"

dotnet user-secrets set "Monnify:ApiKey" "your\_api\_key\_here"

dotnet user-secrets set "Monnify:SecretKey" "your\_secret\_key\_here"





Configuration Classes



Create PaystackConfig and MonnifyConfig classes.



Inject via IOptions<T> in Startup/Program.cs for DI.



3.2. Payment Initialization



Flow:



User selects exam ‚Üí level ‚Üí subscription plan (6 months).



User chooses payment provider (Paystack or Monnify).



Backend generates transaction request and sends to provider API.



Provider returns payment link ‚Üí frontend redirects user.



Paystack InitializeTransaction API



Required fields: amount, email, reference, callback\_url.



Save transactionReference in DB with status = Pending.



Monnify One-Time Payment API



Required fields: amount, customerName, customerEmail, paymentReference.



Save paymentReference in DB with status = Pending.



3.3. Payment Webhooks (Verification Layer)



Webhook Endpoints



/api/payments/paystack/webhook



/api/payments/monnify/webhook



Security



Validate webhook signatures:



Paystack: Check x-paystack-signature against request body + secret key (HMAC SHA512).



Monnify: Validate with hashed secret key as per docs.



Reject if invalid.



Verification



On webhook hit, verify transaction status via provider API (never trust webhook alone).



Update transaction record:



Status = Success ‚Üí Mark subscription as Active (6 months).



Status = Failed ‚Üí Mark as Failed, notify user.



3.4. Receipts \& Record-Keeping



Database Tables



Payments



PaymentId, UserId, ExamId, LevelId, Provider, Amount, Reference, Status, CreatedAt, UpdatedAt.



Receipts



ReceiptId, PaymentId, ReceiptNumber, FilePath/PDFData, IssuedAt.



Receipt Generation



Use QuestPDF or iTextSharp in .NET to auto-generate PDF receipts.



Include: User details, exam/level, provider used, transaction reference, amount, date.



Store in DB or file system (depending on scale).



Delivery



Email receipt to user via SendGrid (or similar).



Also downloadable from user dashboard.



3.5. Subscription Linking



After successful payment ‚Üí update:



UserSubscriptions table with:



UserId, ExamId, LevelId, StartDate, EndDate (6 months later), Status = Active.



If subscription expires ‚Üí mark Expired + notify via email \& dashboard.



3.6. Notifications



Email



Payment successful ‚Üí send confirmation + attached receipt.



Payment failed ‚Üí send retry instructions.



In-App



Show subscription status in dashboard (Active, Expiring Soon, Expired).



Display renewal prompts before expiry (e.g., 2 weeks before).



3.7. Testing \& Monitoring



Test Environments



Use Paystack and Monnify sandbox/test environments for integration.



Verify success, failure, timeout, webhook replay scenarios.



Idempotency



Ensure repeated webhooks/requests don‚Äôt duplicate transactions.



Use unique reference for each payment.



Error Logging



Log failed payments, webhook rejections, invalid signatures.



Build admin dashboard to monitor payment stats.



‚úÖ At the end of Phase 3:



Users can choose Monnify or Paystack.



Payments are securely processed and verified.



Receipts are auto-generated and stored.



Subscriptions are activated \& linked to user.



Notifications (email + in-app) keep users informed.






Phase 4 ‚Äì Renewal \& Expiry Handling
===



This phase ensures users can renew their course subscriptions every 6 months, get proper notifications before and after expiry, and the system maintains accurate subscription statuses.



4.1. Subscription Lifecycle



Active ‚Üí When user subscribes and payment is verified.



Expiring Soon ‚Üí 14 days before expiry.



Expired ‚Üí After end date passes and no renewal.



Renewed ‚Üí When user pays again for the same course level before/after expiry.



4.2. Database Design



UserSubscriptions Table (continuing from Phase 3):



SubscriptionId (PK)



UserId (FK)



ExamId (ATS/ICAN)



LevelId



StartDate



EndDate (StartDate + 6 months)



Status (Active, ExpiringSoon, Expired, Renewed)



RenewalCount (integer)



Audit Trail (optional but recommended):



SubscriptionHistory table ‚Üí log every renewal event with timestamps, payment reference, provider used.



4.3. Expiry \& Renewal Logic



Automatic Expiry



Background job (Hangfire / Quartz.NET) runs daily.



Checks subscriptions where EndDate <= Now.



Updates status ‚Üí Expired.



Sends expiry email + in-app notification.



Expiring Soon Notifications



Background job checks for subscriptions expiring in 14 days.



Status ‚Üí ExpiringSoon.



Send reminder: ‚ÄúYour ICAN Skills subscription is about to expire. Renew now to avoid losing access.‚Äù



Renewal Flow



User clicks Renew button in dashboard.



Redirected to choose provider (Paystack/Monnify).



New payment initialized (reference must be unique).



On success ‚Üí extend EndDate by 6 months.



Increment RenewalCount.



Status ‚Üí Renewed.



4.4. Notifications



Email Triggers



Expiring Soon (14 days before) ‚Üí ‚ÄúRenew now‚Äù CTA.



On Expiry ‚Üí ‚ÄúYour subscription has expired, click here to renew.‚Äù



On Renewal ‚Üí Payment receipt + new subscription dates.



In-App Notifications



Show banners in dashboard.



Example: ‚ÄúATS2 subscription expiring in 12 days. Renew now to continue learning.‚Äù



4.5. Payment Handling for Renewal



Re-use Phase 3 Payment Flow.



Difference:



Instead of creating a fresh subscription, check if an active/expired one exists for (UserId + ExamId + LevelId).



Extend EndDate by 6 months from current expiry.



If expired, set new StartDate = Now, EndDate = Now + 6 months.



4.6. Security \& Integrity



Prevent duplicate renewals:



Use idempotent payment references.



Block renewals if transaction status is still Pending.



Verify payments server-side (again via Monnify/Paystack API).



Log all renewal attempts for auditing.



4.7. Admin Panel Controls



Admin can:



See all active/expired subscriptions.



Manually extend subscriptions (e.g., goodwill cases).



View renewal history per user.



Export reports of renewals vs expiries.



4.8. Testing Scenarios



Normal Renewal: User renews before expiry ‚Üí EndDate extended.



Late Renewal: User renews after expiry ‚Üí New cycle starts from payment date.



Failed Payment: Renewal attempt fails ‚Üí Status unchanged, reminder persists.



Webhook Replay: Ensure multiple webhook hits don‚Äôt create duplicate renewals.



Multiple Subscriptions: Same user can have ICAN + ATS running separately, each with own lifecycle.



‚úÖ At the end of Phase 4:



Subscriptions auto-expire after 6 months.



Users get multiple reminders via email + in-app.



Renewals are smooth, secure, and linked to payment records.



Admins have full control \& visibility.




Phase 5 ‚Äì User Dashboard \& Progress Tracking
===
